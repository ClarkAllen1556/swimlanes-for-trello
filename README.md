Swimlanes for Trello
=======================

Trello is a handy tool for keeping track of list items, but it limits you to a single row of lists. This lightweight, keep-it-simple extension for Trello allows you to create multiple horizontal "swimlanes" of lists.

* First, arrange your Trello lists. The lists for the first lane should come first, followed by the lists for the second lane, and so forth.
* Then, add either the | character or the swimmer emoji &#127946; to the header of any list that should start a new swimlane. (If your keyboard doesn't easily provide the emoji, you can copy-and-paste it from sites like this one: https://www.emojibase.com/emoji/1f3ca/swimmer )
* Any header text that comes after the character will be used as the lane's label. For instance, if you label a list with "Backlog for |Project X", that lane's label will read "Project X". (I recommend that you use a format like this, so that the list headers still make sense to people who don't have this extension.)
* Moving lists around can cause Trello to get confused and show everything in one lane again; just reload the page to fix it. You may also find it easier to toggle off the extension, re-arrange your lists, and then re-enable the extension. (This is not ideal, for certain, but it's so far unavoidable.)

Note: the extension may ask for permission to view your browsing history. This is to allow it to activate itself only on Trello pages; it is inactive anywhere else. It does not and will not collect, save, or transmit your browsing history.
