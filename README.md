Trello Swimlanes
=======================

Trello is a handy tool for keeping track of list items, but it limits you to a single row of lists. This lightweight, keep-it-simple extension for Trello allows you to create multiple horizontal "swimlanes" of lists.

* First, arrange your Trello lists. The lists for the first lane should come first, followed by the lists for the second lane, and so forth.
* Then, add the swimmer emoji to the header of any list that should start a new swimlane. You can copy-and-paste the emoji from here: https://www.emojibase.com/emoji/1f3ca/swimmer
* Any header text that comes after the emoji will be used as the lane's label. For instance, if you label a list with "Backlog for [emoji]Project X", that lane's label will read "Project X". (I recommend that you use a format like this, so that the list headers still make sense to people who don't have this extension.)
